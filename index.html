		<hr>

		<img class="smaller-image" src="assets/images/me.jpg" />

		<p>
		I am from Baltimore, MD (home of the best crab cakes in the world,) but the Queen City is where I call home now.  Why did I move to the Queen City (I'm glad you asked?)  I moved to Charlotte to well... marry my Queen.  We have been married for 3 months now, and the sky is the limit.  We own our own Promotional and Marketing company, "Lomar Specialty Advertising.", and we do not have any children... Yet! 
		</p>
		<p>
		I have a Bachelors Degree in Information Sciences and Systems from Morgan State University.  Prior to joining my Wife and New Mother (what I call my mother-in-law,) I was an Instructional Designer and Corporate Trainer for over 10 years.
