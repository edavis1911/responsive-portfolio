      <p>
        I am from Baltimore, MD (home of the best crab cakes in the world!!!) but the Queen City is where I call home now.  Why did I move to the Queen City (I'm glad you asked...)  I moved to Charlotte to well... marry my Queen.  We have been married for 3 months now, and I couldn't have asked for a  better person to spend the rest of my life with.  We own our own Promotional and Marketing company, "Lomar Specialty Advertising.", and we do not have any children... Yet! 
      </p>
      <p>
        I have a Bachelors Degree in Information Sciences and Systems from Morgan State University. Prior to joining my Wife and New Mother (what I call my mother-in-law,) I was an Instructional Designer and Corporate Trainer for over 10 years.
